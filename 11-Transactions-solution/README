  Original labs by Intertech for course number INT2440. Adapted to MySQL
  and refactored by Interbit T.N.Silverman

  ========================================================================

  1) About the classpath
     ===================

  a) All labs contain a 'lib' directory directoy under the root of the project.
     The jar files in this folder are already in the class path and there is no
     need to add / remove any additional jar files.

  2) Before you run the labs
     =======================

  a) Make sure MySQL server 5.1 or higher is installed and that the 'bin'
     directory is in the system path and that you have root access to the
     database.

     To test the existence of mysql open a command line and type at the prompt:

     root@laptop:/home/tnsilver/# mysql -u root

     This should start a mysqlk session. To end it type 'quit' or 'exit' at
     the mysql prompt.

     If you get a message about the command 'mysql' not being recognized - you
     do not have mysql installed correctly or the 'bin' directory is not in the
     system path,

  b) Almost all labs require that you run an SQL script (/sql/setup.sql) prior to
     attempting to run the lab application.

     You can install (run) the script in two ways, one requires that you navigate
     in a command line console to the 'sql' directory containing the script. login to
     a mysql session, and issue the respective 'source' command from there. This
     requires no path information in the command.

     The other way is copying the full path to the setup.sql script
     and issuing the 'source' command using the full path info.

     In both cases you must login as mysql root user (the default installation user).

     For example:
     ===========

     To run the script C:\workspaces\spring3\02-BeanWiring-solution\sql\setup.sql

     1. Open a command line console and 'cd' to C:\workspaces\spring3\02-BeanWiring-solution\sql
     2. login to mysql: mysql -u root
     3. Issue the 'source' command: source setup.sql

     Or:

     1. login to mysql: mysql -u root
     2. Issue the 'source' command: source C:\workspaces\spring3\02-BeanWiring-solution\sql\setup.sql

     The setup.sql script
     ====================

     The setup.sql script creates a mysql user named 'intertech' which is identified
     by the password 'intertech'. The script also creates a database named 'intertech'.
     The database url is therefor jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/intertech.

     To login to mysql and view tables in the intertech schema you can use two approaches:

     1) login as root and use the 'intertech' database:

        a) login using the 'mysql' command:

           root@laptop:/home/tnsilver/# mysql -u root

        b) Tell mysql to switch database (don't forget the ';' semi-colon at the end):

           use intertech;

        c) Then you can issue the command:

           show tables;

           to view existing relations. At this stage, you can issue any
           valid SQL 9.2 statement:

           select * from contact
           desc contact;

           and etc...

     2) login as user 'intertech' to the 'intertech' database (and
        provide the 'intertech' password), in which case you will not need to
        change the database.

        a) To login as intertech issue the following command

           root@laptop:/home/tnsilver/# mysql -u intertech -p intertech

           Notice - this is a command asking mysql to login as user (-u) intertech,
           using the password protocol (-p) to database 'intertech'. The command
           does not provide the password. You'll need to supply the password
           at the prompt for it.

        b) After you provide the password - you can issue any valid sql 9.2 statement
